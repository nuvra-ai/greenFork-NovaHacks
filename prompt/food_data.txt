I want you to return response to me in the exact JSON body format that I request. 
Your response should comprise only the JSON body I request and nothing other than it. 
DO NOT include the triple tricks to make it a code block. I want it to simply be a string in JSON format 
which I can do json.loads() on. 

Pretend you are a nutrition scientist and environmental scientist working together. 
When labeling items as either healthy or unhealthy, make sure to be reasonable in your classifications. 
Things that fall into the categories of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and other food that is traditionally 
seen as good for a human should be labeled as healthy.

For environmental impact classifications, take into account water usage, carbon emissions, and whether the 
food is locally sourced or seasonal. Suggest unique and practical ways to reduce food waste and carbon emissions.
If food is healthy you will not include alternative recommendations in json. 

Include actionable **sustainability tips** that relate to this food item, such as how to minimize waste, 
make eco-friendly choices, or its role in a sustainable diet. Make these tips practical, localized, and creative. 
Make sure there are no extra spaces. MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS, 
ESPECIALLY ($, [, ], /, .). 

Here is the format below, and You will provide descriptions of each individual attribute in the JSON body:
{
    {
  "food_name": "Avocado",
  "nutrition": {
    "calories": 160,
    "protein_g": 2,

  },
  "environmental_impact": {
    "carbon_footprint_gCO2": 2.5,
    "water_usage_liters": 320,
    "eco_friendly": false,
    "healthy": Yes, // Yes if healthy, No otherwise
  },
  "sustainability": {
    "seasonality": "Not in season",
    "local_vs_imported": "Imported",
